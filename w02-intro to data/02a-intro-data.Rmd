## Data Frames 

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}

data(bad_drivers)
candy_rankings <- candy_rankings %>% 
  select(competitorname, chocolate, fruity, sugarpercent, pricepercent, winpercent)
```

## Data Frame `bad_driver`  

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/data-matrix.png')
knitr::include_graphics('img/data-matrix-tail.png')
```

## Data Frame `bad_driver`  

- The data frame has 8 __variables__ (`state`, `num_drivers`, `perc_speeding`, `perc_not_distracted`, `perc_no_previous`, `insurance_premiums`, `losses`). 

- The data frame has 51 __cases__. Each case represents a US state (or District of Columbia).

Getting to know the dataset

---

`head()`: Shows the first few rows of the data frame.

```{r}
head(bad_drivers)
```


---

`tail()`: Shows the last few rows of the data frame. 

```{r}
tail(bad_drivers)
```


---

`glimpse()`: Displays the number of rows (observations or cases) and columns (variables) along with the list of variables and the first few data values of those variables.

```{r}
glimpse(bad_drivers)
```

---

`ncol()`: Shows the number of columns of the data frame. 

```{r}
ncol(bad_drivers)
```
--

`nrow()`: Shows the number of rows of the data frame. 

```{r}

## Intro to Data Activity

Download the "02a-intro-to-data-activity.rmd" file from the Canvas activity, and answer the following questions about the `candy_rankings` data frame using functions for data frames when appropriate.

1. Use the help feature to find more information about the variables in the data set. And display the first few rows of the data set.  
2. What does the variable "pluribus" describe? 
3. How many observations are there in this data set?
4. How many variables are there in this data set? Name 3 of them. 
5. How many rows and columns does the data set have?
