#Math 220: Intro to Data Science
##Introduction to the Course


---

class: middle

## Course Description

This course introduces the foundations of data science. Topics include data collection, data wrangling, exploratory analysis and visualization, introduction to statistical modeling, prediction and classification, and model outcome interpretations. Applications include real data from a wide-range of fields following reproducible practices. Applications to business, biological sciences, and social sciences are emphasized. Students will use computer software, RStudio, for statistical analysis of various topics.

--

### COURSE STUDENTS LEARNING OUTCOMES
1. The student will be able to read and extract information from a given data set, and explore the data using numerical summaries and visualizations, while writing clean code using R.
2. The student will be able to make predictions and conclusions using models, and consider the ethics and impact of decisions resulted from data analysis, while writing clean code using R.
